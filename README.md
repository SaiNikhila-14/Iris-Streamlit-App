ðŸŒ¸ Iris Flower Species Predictor
This is a simple, end-to-end Machine Learning project that demonstrates the full pipeline
from model training and evaluation to deployment in a web application. 
The application predicts the species of an Iris flower based on its physical measurements.

Status	Details
Live App	https://iris-app-app-zdzdukvdnags9ourvyffih.streamlit.app/
Model Type	Supervised Classification (K-Nearest Neighbors)
Deployment	Streamlit Cloud (via GitHub)
Accuracy	100% (on the test set)


ðŸ§  Machine Learning Overview
The objective is to classify an Iris flower into one of three species: Setosa, Versicolor, or Virginica.

Dataset: The famous Iris dataset (sklearn.datasets.load_iris).

Algorithm: K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) is used due to its simplicity and high performance on this linearly separable dataset.

Key Features (Inputs):

Sepal Length (cm)

Sepal Width (cm)

Petal Length (cm)

Petal Width (cm)
